# Maze
Generates a random maze of a specfied size and solves it

Run 'make' in your terminal to compile

run with ./maze

edit the preprocessed variables in the .c file to change maze width and height, works better with odd values

default solution finds a path from top left to bottom right, and fills it with o's

I may get around to porting this to android for fun
